= Reference to the call for tenders (Procurement project identifier)

The pre-award catalogue must refer to a previous call for tenders with pre-award catalogue request, often called the *procurement project identifier*. The identifier must be provided in the element  `cac:ReferencedContract/cac:ContractDocumentReference/cbc:ID` with `cac:ReferencedContract/cbc:ContractTypeCode` = 311.

When the referenced call for tenders has lots, the lot identifier must be sent at line level in the element `cbc:ContractSubdivision`.
