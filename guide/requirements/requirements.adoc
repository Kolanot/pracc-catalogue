.Item requirements
[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|====
|Id
|Requirement

|op-t68-040
|An item is a specification within a catalogue line of an offer of a product by the economic operator that can be ordered by the contracting authority.

|op-t68-041
|An item in a pre-award catalogue shall be uniquely identifiable by a name and an identifier, to ensure that the item can be referenced, e.g., by an id.

|op-t68-042
|An item may have a description.

|op-t68-043
|It shall be possible to specify how an item can be ordered. This includes amongst others allowed units of measure, order sizes, minimal and maximal order sizes. There might exist restrictions from the production process or a need to simplify or limit the costs of the ordering and logistics process, so that the order size is restricted. Thus, the buyer needs information to place a correct order that is not denied by the supplier.

|op-t68-044
|It shall be possible to specify how the delivered items will be packaged. To indicate from which number of ordered order units this package unit will be delivered.

|op-t68-045
|It shall be possible to specify logistic conditions and other needed service information on how the item will be delivered. This includes information on maximum and minimum storage temperature, information needed for cross-border logistics processes. To define the products to be done for each package unit along the supply chain.

|op-t68-046
|It shall be possible to specify how the item is priced. This includes factors that have influence on the price as well as relationships to other parts of the catalogue that may have impact on the price. The price can be dependent on many factors, e.g., order size, delivery region (down to the city level), allowance, charges, currency, etc.

|op-t68-047
|It should be possible to specify the period of time an item price is valid. If no validity period is specified, the price is valid until cancelled. The same as in tbr19-003, but on the item level. This allows to have items with different validity periods in the same catalogue. This does not mean, that the item will expire. It only means, that after this period the item has to be ordered for a different price.

|op-t68-048
|Prices shall not be negative.

|op-t68-049
|It shall be possible to provide information that helps to search for the item, e.g., keywords or item description used in a full text search.

|op-t68-050
|It shall be possible to refer an item to the corresponding classes from one or more classification systems.

|op-t68-051
|An item might be illustrated by attached images.

|op-t68-052
|An item might include further specifications as attachments.

|op-t68-053
|It might be specified how the item will be delivered. This includes information on the packaging and the conditions for certain delivery locations.

|op-t68-054
|An item shall include information that allow to compare the item with other items.

|op-t68-055
|It should be possible to provide information on the product marking, e.g., to indicate that environmental or social requirements on the item production were followed. Procurement managers need information about environmental marking applicable for a given item in order to ensure that environmental, ecological, food safety and basic human rights aspects were respected. On the other side, sales managers wish to provide this kind of information, e.g., for marketing purposes.

|op-t68-056
|It should be possible to specify the manufacturer of the item. In particular, for the case where the supplier is different from the manufacturer of the item.

|op-t68-057
|It should be possible to specify hazard indicators for an item by any indicator system. If an item can be a danger to people or the environment, so called hazardous goods, often legal requirements demand that such items have indicators to indicate the danger that come from this item. Furthermore, such items require special handling in the logistics process

|op-t68-058
|It shall be possible to specify the semantic relationships with cardinalities between different items in the pre-award catalogue request. In particular, it shall be possible to specify part-of relationships, to specify that not only an item is tendered, but also additional items belonging to it. E.g., items that are accessories for other items or are replacements for defect components of an item. This helps to specify for instance that not only printers are tendered, but also print cartridges.

|op-t68-059
|It should be possible to specify a delivery location on line level, with address, city, post code, etc., so that all details on each line are dependent on this location, including price, tax and other specifications. Needed to support the buying decision, to see how much has to be paid in the end.

|op-t68-060
|It should be possible to specify a manufacturing date, a best before date and an expiry date (last date when product may be used or consumed) for an item.

|op-t68-061
|It should be possible to state the country of origin for an item.

|An item property has to be uniquely identifiable, to ensure that the item property can be referenced.

|It shall be possible to specify a range of allowed values for an item property. In order to allow the supplier to offer only values in the range the contracting body needs (e.g. for a RAM memory the contracting body needs values of 1, 2 or 3 GB and no other values, for a maintenance service the action is request within 1 day). The values information allows also a validation check with respect to the offer of the economic operator.

|op-t68-075
|An item property might be described using free text.
